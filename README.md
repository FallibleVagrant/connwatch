This project is roughly equivalent to typing 'watch ss' into the terminal. Currently it doesn't do much else other than some network connectivity.

## Build from Source

You need to have the ncurses development files in order to `make` this project.
```
sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev
```

Then, simply call:
```
make
```
